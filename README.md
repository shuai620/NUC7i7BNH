### Don't work

+ Sleep doesn't work for Ventura.

### Upgrade to OC_1.0.4

+ Recompile most of the outdated kext with Xcode 15.2 and Lilu 1.6.9

### Before upgrading to Monterey

+ Remove "FakePCIID.kext", otherwise the computer will freeze after booting for about 10 mins !!! After removing "FakePCIID.kext", HMDI audio needs reconnection to be identified. Don't use old "FakePCIID.kext"!!!

+ New progress!! Intel HMDI audio has been fixed by recompiling "FakePCIID.kext" with Xcode 13, and "fakepciid_intel_hdmi_audio.kext" has been integrated into new "FakePCIID.kext".

+ Replace "IntelBluetoothInjector.kext" with "BlueToolFixup.kext". 

### Before upgrading to Ventura from Monterey

+ Replace "AirportItlwm.kext" with Ventura version.

### Comments

+ Fix HEVC support in VideoProc, by delete the item in "config.plist": DeviceProperties -> PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0) -> "AAPL,slot-name".

+ Enable Sidecar by switching iMac16,2 to iMac18,1 (logout AppleID first before switching).

+ Switching from iMac18,1 to MacBookPro14,2, CPU power management will be more balanced.

+ update 'USBMap.kext'.

+ Enable build-in microphone by changing "layout-ID=15".

+ Inject CPU power management data in CPUFriendDataProvider.kext, thanks to https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend. Or use ssdtPRGen.sh to generate ssdt.aml, https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh. Choose either method.
